## Run

1. Place ```train_hh_features.csv```, ```train_hh_gt.csv``` & ```train_hh_features.csv``` in the Root Directory.
2. Run ```Notebook.ipynb``` to generate ```predicted_household_consumption.csv``` . There is no explanation in it but the code is straightforward.

- As the process of generating ```predicted_poverty_distribution.csv``` from ```predicted_household_consumption.csv``` is trivial, I have not included that code here.
